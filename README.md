## Tutorial: Publishing with GitHub Pages

If you want to publish your website on GitHub Pages, here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Create a [new repository](https://github.com/new) on GitHub, give it a name, then check the "Initialize this repository with a README" checkbox)
2. On the new repository page, visit the `[Settings]` tab, then the `[Pages]` item in the left sidebar
3. Under "Build and deployment" > "Branch" change the branch from `None` to `main` (don't change other settings)
4. Select `[Save]` (the site URL will be displayed at the top of the page)
5. Clone the repository to your local machine (tip: using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an easy way to do this)
6. Locate the location on your local machine where you cloned the repository
7. Open the HTML file in your text editor of choice
8. Add your content to the HTML file
9. Save the HTML file
10. Commit your changes to the local repository (tip: using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an easy way to do this)
11. Push your changes to the remote repository (tip: using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an easy way to do this)
12. Wait for a minute or two and visit the site URL to see your website live
13. Great success: your changes are published and live on the web (hosted by GitHub Pages)
